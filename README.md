# second_screen_shifter
Shifting your application from primary screen to second screen.
If your primary screen is first, it will set the app to the last screen, opposite, your primary screen is not the first, then the app will be set to the first screen.
-sdl_displayindex x is used for starting an application,but not support applications by xxx launchers which is why I wrote this exe.
Only one condition:
run as administrator.
